# Slackware for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSLackware is a version of Slackware optimized for Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Server.

WSLackware comes with almost no major modifications comparing to upstream Slackware and the binaries come directly from official Slackware repositories, however WSLackware it's stripped down a bit and added small tweaks to work well with WSL.

WSLackware is NOT maintained and indorsed by official Slackware developers (yet) and it's supported on a community-based basis. 

## About

We brought Slackware to Windows because be believed that it's the perfect distro for WSL. Firstly because of the simplicity of the init system and the whole OS in general and high-performance binaries it contains; and we hope one day this project gets supported by official Slackware developers.
